Given a network containing 'n' nodes numbered from 1-n which if of tree shaped. You are also given Edge containing edges Edge[i] = [ui,vi,wi], where 'ui' is source node, 
'vi' is target node and 'wi' is the weight of edge. You are also given starting node 's'. A data packet can be transmitted from node1 to node2 only if the size of packet 
is less than or equal to the weight of the edge connecting these nodes. You are sending packets from given starting node 's' and these packets will reach the leaf/end 
nodes following the above rule. You will need to find the maximum sum of size of all packets which can be transferred from the starting node 's'.
